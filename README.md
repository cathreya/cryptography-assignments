# Cryptography Assignments

These are Assignments done as part of the Principles of Information Security course at IIITH, Spring 2020. Write ups for each assignment are available in pdf format. There is also a video demonstrating the code being run. 

- Evaluation 1: Implements digital signature scheme based on a zero-knowledge proof for the discrete log problem. Based on the hardness of the discrete log problem, also implements a collision resistant hash function that makes use of the Merkle Damgard transform.

- Evaluation 2: Implements a fault tolerant storage system using polynomials and digital signatures. 

- Evaluation 3: Implements a stack data structure where the pointers are replaced by hash pointers and hash-sign pointers. This simulates a sort of immutable ledger like in the case of blockchain.

- Evaluation 5: Implements a fault tolerant send-receive scheme. Uses a public key system to acheive oblivious transfer.
